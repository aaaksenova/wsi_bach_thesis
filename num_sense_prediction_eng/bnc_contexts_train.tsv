curriculum	Surprisingly, the most extreme curriculum has been adopted not in Chicago or Detroit but in Portland, Oregon's sleepy capital.	31-41	1
curriculum	As Furth ( 1982 ) points out, this may result in increased status differentiation within higher education between subjects or institutions ; it may also affect the ‘ hidden ’ curriculum of assumed values, perspectives and relationships ( Becker et al.	175-185	1
curriculum	First, there is the problem of how to integrate the fragmented educational administration ; and second, how to put into effect a new curriculum to replace the South African one.	133-143	1
curriculum	The second example, a frequent concomitant of the first, is the notion that it is good primary practice to have the different groups pursuing different areas of the curriculum at any one time, because only thus can the goals of ‘ seamlessness ’ and ‘ flexibility ’ in curriculum and learning be achieved.	165-175	1
curriculum	The Project Coordinating Team's commitment to whole - school involvement in curriculum - related library planning was paralleled by the involvement of faculty, departmental and pastoral representatives on the library committee.	76-86	1

curriculum	Others will prefer a curriculum with no evident pattern beyond personal inclination or skills.	21-31	1
curriculum	We need to produce materials to match the individual needs of students and curricula ; because this is very time - consuming and difficult, we co - operate at school level by team teaching, by keeping a central indexed pool of locally produced materials, and by intelligent planning, and at out of school level by coordinating our efforts through teachers'centres and curriculum development schemes.	368-378	1
curriculum	The denial of opportunity which would arise from the operation of a different curriculum is not, however, inherent in the educational process.	78-88	1
curriculum	I think one of the biggest problems we've got or I've I've had in the last couple of years is that we've got so many primary schools that we get children from Spring Gardens and Western are now producing national curriculum information for which Marian has got.	213-223	1
curriculum	Change within the curriculum itself was also under way.	18-28	1
curriculum	Southmead Hospital has an excellent induction and core curriculum educational programme, which could be coordinated regionally or nationally ; it also organises regular trouble shooting meetings between lead consultants, managers, and all levels of junior medical staff.	55-65	1
curriculum	Students'personal autonomy cannot be guaranteed even by the best curriculum in the world.	65-75	1

curriculum	Finally, the research aims to generate insights into the initial and inservice training needs of teachers in respect of the relationship between curriculum design and the organisation of library provision.	145-155	1
curriculum	The teaching of religion was always a feature of the curriculum, and until 1988 was the one subject legally required.	53-63	1
curriculum	His Technique became fundamental to the whole school curriculum.	53-63	1
curriculum	Often it is a combination of adaptations to the classroom environment and to materials used for learning that will be most helpful in terms of giving pupils with defective vision the opportunity to have access to the full curriculum followed in the class.	222-232	1
curriculum	The particular language and communication needs of these students were analysed by ESL teachers, drawing on a variety of theoretical and educational developments including the concept ‘ language across the curriculum ’, sociolinguistic research evidence on classroom interaction and the work done in the area of English for Specific Purposes.	206-216	1
curriculum	"Rowntree's general comment on all this is much to the point : "" The hidden curriculum marches on."	75-85	1
curriculum	With this in mind, those concerned with information management in schools need to be aware of any new technologies which can assist in the development of learning skills which are relevant across and beyond the curriculum.	211-221	1
curriculum	Accordingly the process of curriculum development involved a team of ‘ experts ’ at the ‘ centre ’ providing the knowledge base for an innovation, then producing an appropriate content and strategy, and finally communicating it effectively to potential users at the periphery.	27-37	1
curriculum	Mrs Postance believes that the heavy digging already completed to prepare the ground for the national curriculum has had a beneficial effect, at least on the teachers, even if the children have yet to reap the harvest : ‘ It's focused our minds on what we are teaching.	102-112	1
curriculum	Lastly I fear that because the Mathematics programmes came first and were so well organised and established, with the neat sequential task of curriculum development so easy to define ( despite its obvious size ), there may have been a tendency to concentrate scarce resources upon an item which, on sober reflection, I believe now to be a lowish priority in the primary curriculum.	142-152	1
entity	Thus we might, in the case of names, allow a representation like : The explicit omission of round brackets conveys the claim that the name identifies some entity directly, not through the mention of some properties.	155-161	1

entity	For an EMPLOYEE entity, for example, an EMPLOYEE entity occurrence who happens to be a manager manages other occurrences of the entity EMPLOYEE.	16-22	1
entity	In ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) we have the less common case of a property extended by an entity, E P ; we continue to assume that a qualified property remains a property : Where we are considering some actual form of words with a view to describing their categorizations and relationships, and especially where the phrases are somewhat more complex, it may be appropriate to partly invert the notation, and to omit the separate representation of the word - meaning, as in ( 21 ) which so depicts the intensional structure of ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) : Qualification is clearly an ordered relation and we shall assume that it is a binary relation ; one of the two elements related is the principal element ( on co - ordination, see Section 1.9 and Chapter 8 ).	79-85	1
entity	Titmuss's concept of society as an organic entity is, for market liberals, simply metaphysics : society is no more than the individuals and families who make it up.	43-49	1
entity	Further work on the transfer of CAD data between work units and independent sites has been based around the idea that it is necessary to transfer all stored entities.	157-165	1
entity	As the technical programmes evolved, they gave rise to commercial activities — such as selling fuel elements and graphite to the civil power stations — and as these matured it became the practice to spin them off as separate entities or to transfer the technology and the responsibility to commercial organisations.	225-233	1
entity	The party's September conference in Brighton ‘ was the point at which we said ‘ right, this is a political entity that's going to continue ’.	107-113	1
entity	Bolinger gives the following set of examples, which do genuinely appear to show qualification of the sense alone, that is, of the property which identifies the entity, rather than of the entity itself : ( 1 ) total stranger lawful heir distant cousin mere kid To these, we might add the cases in ( 2 ) ; notice that the last example would be self - contradictory if the adjective were interpreted as an ordinary attributive : ( 2 ) Brent is a strong Republican the document was a complete blank ( If faced with a claim that we can explain the peculiarity of these adjectives by simply stating that they are adverbial impostors, we may respond that, even supposing that, deep down, there may be something adverbial about them, nonetheless speakers have chosen to use an adjective rather than an adverb, and this adjectival use needs to be described and if possible explained.	160-166	1
entity	Here, the fact that the adjective property is applicable to the object entity in a whole construction like ( 22 ) is intimately connected with the lexical meaning of the verb, and will thereby be understood to be applicable to the entity of the object even when that is considered in isolation.	71-77	1
entity	The values of a set of attributes will distinguish one entity occurrence from another.	55-61	1
entity	The topological instructions can be written as a hierarchical framework allowing edge, surface or solid representations to be constructed from the same group of nodal entities.	167-175	1

entity	Here we shall restrict the term to those aspects of language structure that encode the social identities of participants ( properly, incumbents of participant - roles ), or the social relationship between them, or between one of them and persons and entities referred to.	96-104	1
entity	It is natural to assume that =, whether assigned or not, cannot normally relate intensional elements of different types, i. e. an entity and a property ( but see ( 37 ) ).	130-136	1
entity	The fundamental assumption made by company law is that the functions and powers of the company, as an artificial legal entity, are exercised by two organs : the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders.	119-125	1
entity	The strong association between such histological and endoscopic entities is in agreement with the suggestion that duodenitis and duodenal ulceration might represent different points in a disease spectrum with a common underlying pathogenesis.	64-72	1
entity	The first was that this contractual conception of the company conflicted with the theory prevailing in the case - law that treated the company as an artificial entity, separate and distinct from its shareholders.	160-166	1
entity	As we have seen, it is hard to draw the line between a conscious human being and a conscious machine likewise, we have to accept that any entity possessed of consciousness is in reality a living organism — whatever its physical characteristics.	138-144	1
entity	However, before proceeding, it is important to note the way in which diverse and sometimes contradictory theories — together with their associated methods — find a place in a broader entity.	183-189	1
entity	A duty to act in the interests of the entity or enterprise would therefore make sense if understood as a duty to benefit a range of corporate ‘ constituencies ’, permitting the directors to balance the various interests as they see fit in the take - over or any other context.	38-44	1
entity	Children evidently realize this quite early in the process of language acquisition, and accept the fact that different words may refer to the same entity — e. g., our dog, Fred, that wretched animal, and so on.	147-153	1
entity	Here we are concerned with bimolecular associations where adverse entropy changes denote loss of translational ( position ) and rotational ( orientation ) motions that occur when two entities come together to form one complex.	183-191	1

entity	This depends on such considerations as whether the wider context includes an indication of negation or counterfactuality, and also on the lexical character of the verb with which the adjective is in immediate construction, since the property of the adjective is not applied to the entity in isolation but only as part of the property complex constituted by the adjective and the verb properties taken together.	281-287	1
entity	the potential recourse of the provider of finance is clearly limited solely to the funds generated by the asset it finances, with no right of recourse whatsoever to other assets of the entity ; and	185-191	1

inflation	A rise in the inflation rate can be bad for both conventional and index - linked gilts.	14-23	2
inflation	Then if Mr Major takes a cool look at why Mrs Thatcher was overthrown, why he became Prime Minister in 1990, and why he came so near to defeat in 1992, he will see a cycle of excessive boom, high inflation and then prolonged recession.	196-205	2
inflation	This depreciation should tend to offset the effects of the domestic inflation.	68-77	2
inflation	Thus aggregate output is equal to its natural rate, β and some positive function of the difference between actual and expected inflation.	127-136	2
inflation	Aggregating together union and non - union wages and substituting out firms'demand for labour, one may obtain a reduced real wage equation positively related to output, lagged real wages and employer taxes on labour and negatively to unexpected inflation benefits and employee taxes.	245-254	2

inflation	Broadly the period 1951 – 87 can be divided into four parts : 1951 – 64, a period of comparatively little social policy innovation which may be regarded as a time of consolidation or stagnation, according to one's political viewpoint ; 1964 – 74, a period of fairly intense policy change stimulated by both political parties, in which considerable difficulties were experienced in translating aspirations into practice ; 1974 – 78, a period in which rapid inflation and government by the Labour party without a parliamentary majority administered a severe shock to the political and social system, and to all who believed that there was still a need for developments in social policy ; and 1979 – 87, when much more explicitly anti - welfare state Conservative administrations reinforced that shock by deliberately treating inflation as more deserving of its attention than unemployment, attacking public services which were seen as inhibiting economic recovery and seeking ways to ‘ privatize ’ public services.	456-465	2
